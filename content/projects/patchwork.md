# About

## Background

This little tool provides a way to visualise Modular Synthesizer patches using a markup language developed by [Spektro Audio](https://github.com/SpektroAudio/Patchbook)

I somehow came across [Patchbook](https://github.com/SpektroAudio/Patchbook) and wanted to try and create a "nicer" visualisation than the suggested one.

## Modules

I developed it so it could visualise any module by simply using a generic face plate, but I also added support for some of the modules I owned at the time. This proved to be one of those good in theory but not in practice ideas, as there are far too many modules to support, and having to map all the module jacks to image coordinates is just not feasible!
