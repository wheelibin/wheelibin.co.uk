# About

- Each planet has a procedurally generated terrain using a noise/height map.

- The 3rd planet from the star will always have Earth type colours, the others are random colours.

- Sizes, orbit radiuses, number of planets, number of moons etc. are all randomly generated using a seeded random number, so you can get the exact solar system back by using the seed.

- The solar system data is based on real-life values and you can see more info about each planet by clicking on the names in the gui panel.

- The orbits are compressed, and the planets enlarged, in order to have a nice view of the solar system, but if you enable "True Scale" you will see the real scales and distances just to see how big space is :-)
