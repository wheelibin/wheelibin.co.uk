# About

A simulation of very basic life forms floating around in...well, something.

- Prey float around and will bounce off the perimeter and each other
- Predators lock on to the nearest prey, chase it down, consume it, then repeat
- Prey will run away from predators if within a certain range

Seems to perform best in Chrome.
