# About

A [spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) where the wheel/pen doesn't slip and ruin everything.

You can add as many "cogs" as you like and specify the hole position on the cog.

## Credits

Massive credit to the article below for simplifying the maths behind plotting the points.
